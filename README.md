# Face-classification
## Dataset
The dataset contains images of size 64 × 64 for all xyz channels. In this competition, we are dealing with faces from 4000 people
(That being said, we have 4000 classes.) 

•  For classification, we will be given a human face image. What we need to do is to learn to classify
this image into correct people IDs.

• For verification, we will be given two images, and we need to calculate the similarity score for those
images using the embeddings generated by your classification network. Notice that for verification, the
test identities are disjoint from the training identities, i.e. our network should be able to tell whether
two images belong to the same person or not, even if it has never seen those people before. This is
known as open-set protocol.
