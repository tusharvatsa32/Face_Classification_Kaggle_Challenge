# Face-classification
## Dataset
The data for the assignment can be downloaded from the Kaggle competition link. 89. The dataset contains
images of size 64 × 64 for all xyz channels. In this competition, we are dealing with faces from 4000 people
(That being said, we have 4000 classes.) 10
This assignment contains 2 parts.
• For classification, you will be given a human face image. What you need to do is to learn to classify
this image into correct people IDs.
• For verification, you will be given two images, and you need to calculate the similarity score for those
images using the embeddings generated by your classification network. Notice that for verification, the
test identities are disjoint from the training identities, i.e. your network should be able to tell whether
two images belong to the same person or not, even if it has never seen those people before. This is
known as open-set protocol.
